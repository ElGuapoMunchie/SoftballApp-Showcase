        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>This project is a cross-platform mobile application developed for Extra Inning Softball, a digital magazine
          with a
          substantial mobile user base. Built using Flutter and Dart, the app connects to a WordPress backend and
          integrates
          JWT authentication for secure user login and tiered membership access.
        </p>
        <p>Our team of four Computer Science seniors completed the application over five sprints, using agile
          methodology
          to
          iteratively refine user experience and performance.
        </p>
        <p>Key features include dynamic content retrieval via the WordPress REST API, a responsive UI with dark mode
          support,
          personalized settings (display preferences, account info), and streamlined navigation for both free and
          premium
          users. The project also involved implementing secure credential storage, state management, and custom theming
          to
          align with the brand’s existing web design.
        </p>
        <p>To enhance usability beyond the existing website, we introduced content filtering and a comprehensive search
          function- features currently unavailable on the EIS site. The app also includes dedicated pages such as Home,
          News,
          Nominations/Rankings, and Polls, reflecting the most frequently accessed areas by users.
        </p>
        <p>By emphasizing agile principles- such as continuous feedback, sprint retrospectives, and user-focused
          testing-
          we
          delivered a secure, high-performance application that aligns with the brand’s design language and serves the
          needs
          of both casual readers and paid subscribers.

        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>Using Flutter and Dart, our team developed a cross-platform mobile application that displays a variety of
          content from the Extra Inning Softball (EIS) website. The site's content- including articles, images, tables,
          and YouTube videos- is hosted through WordPress, with certain posts restricted to different membership tiers
          via
          the MemberPress plugin.
        </p>
        <p>To access both public and restricted content, we implemented a background authentication service using JSON
          Web
          Tokens (JWT) and a WordPress plugin, enabling secure communication between the app and the existing backend
          infrastructure. We also incorporated secure local storage, allowing users to remain logged in between sessions
          without needing to re-authenticate each time the app is launched.
        </p>
        <p>If a user encounters restricted content while not logged in, they are able to view a preview of the article
          before being prompted to either sign in or create an account.
        </p>
        <p>The app also features several dedicated pages, including a Home page, a searchable and filterable News feed,
          a
          Rankings page, and a Polls page. Additionally, users can navigate to the Settings menu to customize in-app
          display preferences and manage their account login and registration status.
        </p>
        <p>Throughout development, we prioritized testing for both user-facing components and backend features to ensure
          a
          stable, reliable experience. Ultimately, this resulted in an application that we are proud to present and
          showcase.
